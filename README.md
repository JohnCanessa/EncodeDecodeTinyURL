# EncodeDecodeTinyURL
LeetCode 535. Encode and Decode TinyURL in Java
https://leetcode.com/problems/encode-and-decode-tinyurl/

You probably have noted that when you select a video from YouTube
the associated URL seem to follow a pattern.
It seems that YouTube uses their own implementation of tiny URL.

In this problem, we are required to build a simple mechanism to
encode and decode a URL.

If interested in my comments and approach, I invite you to visit
the following post in my blog:

Keep in mind that the best way to learn is to read and experiment.

Enjoy;
